Our department has a number of summer scholarships available to Kiwi and Aussie students, including those returning to NZ or AUS to study in 2021.
Come work with us &mdash; it's [fun]({% post_url 2019-02-21-summer %})!

Here is an idea for the project that you can do at the bioDS lab:

#### Quantitative methods for comparing viral transmission histories

> In a [recent study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12307) [we](/) designed an effective method to compare timed evolutionary histories known in epidemiology as transmission trees.
> Our method can, for example, distinguish an influenza outbreak from an HIV outbreak by only looking at the histories of transmission events.
> This summer project will contribute to developing powerful and scalable algorithms for computational genomics.
> Specifically, the student will work with other members of the bioDS lab to design and implement efficient algorithms for comparing timed evolutionary histories.
> No biological background will be necessary and the project can suit someone interested in at least one of the following areas: algorithms (ideally online algorithms), computational complexity, phylogenetics, statistical modelling, discrete mathematics


And [here are](/assets/2020-09-23-summer_bursaries.pdf) all projects offered by the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.otago.ac.nz/computer-science/index.html) with further details about the scholarship and how to apply.

Drop [Alex](/alex/) a line if you're interested and/ or what to learn more about the projects.
