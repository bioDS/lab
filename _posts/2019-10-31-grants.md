We are stoked to announce that [MBIE](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/) has recently funded two of our research programmes.

First, we are starting an exciting collaboration with [Alexei Drummond](https://alexeidrummond.org/), [Sarah Diermeier](https://www.otago.ac.nz/biochemistry/people/profile/index.html?id=2797), and [Rob Lanfear](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/lanfear-rm) to develop and implement a phylodynamics software platform for evolutionary analyses of somatic sequencing data, funded by the [MBIE Endeavour (Smart Ideas)](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/science-and-technology/science-and-innovation/funding-information-and-opportunities/investment-funds/endeavour-fund/) fund.
Jiří is already working on the project and we are keen to hire up to three PhD students (based in Dunedin, Auckland, or Canberra) and at least one postdoc (based in Dunedin or Auckland) to take this project to the next level.
If that is you, please [get in touch](/alex/).

Second, the [MBIE Data Science programme](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2019/10/29/major-funding-boost-for-data-science.html), which involves a significant biological data science component, has received $10,000,000 to develop New Zealand data science capabilities.
All [projects led or co-led by our lab](/opportunities/) have received support within this programme, so stay tuned for opportunities or [approach](/alex/) us straight away if [online algorithms in computational biology](/opportunities/) is your cup of tea.

Exciting year so far and we are ready for the challenge!
